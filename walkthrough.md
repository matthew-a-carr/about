# Homepage UX Walkthrough

## task_boundary (simulated)
- Mode: VERIFICATION

## Before / After
- Before: Linear sections with repeated card styling; limited navigation and weak action hierarchy; hero and snapshot felt disconnected.
- After: Anchored navigation, clearer hierarchy, integrated snapshot beside hero, outcome highlights, and a step-by-step operating model to build trust quickly.

## UX Improvements Summary
- Clearer primary action (Email me) with supporting actions (GitHub, LinkedIn).
- Improved wayfinding via anchored nav and skip link.
- Stronger narrative flow: outcomes → process → skills → current role → contact.
- Visual hierarchy strengthened with staged reveal and contrast-driven hero.
- Motion honors reduced-motion user preferences.

## Accessibility Score
- WCAG 2.1 AA: preliminary pass for structure + focus states; contrast verification pending.

## Future Recommendations
- Add measurable proof points (SLO improvements, latency wins, cost savings).
- Add case study cards with quantified outcomes.
- Run automated a11y audit (axe/Lighthouse) and fine-tune contrast if needed.
